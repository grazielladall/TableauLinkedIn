# TableauLinkedIn

It's not a surprise that your network has the potential to provide you with insight into different fields, information on what potential employers look for and advice on how you can improve professionally. Among the many social networking options available today, LinkedIn stands out as a top option for professionals and job seekers. For that reason, I decided to take a look at my LinkedIn data to see if I am on the right track:

Facts to take into consideration:

* My LinkedIn Registration Date: 04/05/2020
* Total LinkedIn Connections: 938
* Dashboard generation Date: 10/06/2022

Key Insights:

* 2020 was my first year on the platform. Starting from Mars 2021, I could invest more time expanding my contact network. April 2022 reached the peak with an average of 4 connections per day. 
* Data Analyst is the most frequent position among my contacts, followed by Data Scientist, which is aligned with my desired career path.
The financial industry is leading the distribution of my networking with companies such as RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO and CIBC.   
* Wednesday is the day of the week that I had the highest number of connections, going down as the week goes on, and then increasing again on Mondays. This result may confirm my hypothesis that people usually tend to avoid connecting on weekends. 
* The peaks in connections were on April 28th 2021 (22 connections) and April 27th 2022 (32 connections), when I participated in Toronto Womxn in Data Science event. Social events focused on your career path are a great way to build valuable connections.

More insights when playing with the data:

* 414 invitations received in the last 6 months
* 102 invitations sent in the last 6 months

More to consider: 
Is there a relationship between lockdown and the number of connections? With events shifting to online mode, did it allow me to create more or fewer strong connections?

I used Tableau for cleaning and manipulating the data, creating calculated fields and visuals. 

Final thought: networking is not only about connecting with people on social media but making strong relationships by sharing ideas and focusing on helping!
